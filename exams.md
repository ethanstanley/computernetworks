We will have three exams in this course. All exams will be during the lecture slot (2.55 PM to 4.10 PM). The exams will have very short answer questions, including but not limited to multiple choice questions. Exams are open notes. You are allowed to bring a fixed number of pages (printed or handwritten) to the exam. You are not allowed any electronic devices during the exam (laptops, tablets, phones). Before each exam, we will hold a review session. Details of the review session will be announced in class and on Ed Discussions.
